 *Perform a program in Java where two arrays are created: the first

 *  of 20 numbers, also real. The program must initialize array A with
 *  random numbers and display it on the screen. Then array A must
 *  be sorted from lowest to highest and copy the first 10 numbers
 *  sorted to array B of 20 elements, and fill the last 10 elements
 *  with the value 0.5. Show the two resulting arrangements: the
 *  ordered of 50 elements and the combined of 20.
