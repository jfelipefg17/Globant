/**
 * Letâ€™s put aside for a moment the concept of POO, now we will work
 * only with the Date class. In this exercise we will have to instantiate
 * in the main, a date using the Date class, for this we will have to
 * create 3 variables, day, month and year that the user will be asked
 * to put the constructor of the Date object. Once you have created
 * the date of type Date, you must show it and show how many years
 * there are between that date and the current date, which can be
 * achieved by instantiating a Date object with an empty constructor.
 *
 * Example date: Date date = new Date(anio, month, day);
 *
 * Current date example: Date date date = new Date();
