/**
 * A store that sells mobile phones wants to keep track of every
 * product it owns in a computer system. To do this, we will create
 * a program where you can store each product with your information.
 * Create a Movil entity with brand, price, model, memory, storage
 * and code attributes. The code attribute shall be a numeric array
 * of dimension 7 (seven) where each subscript shall house a number
 * corresponding to the code. The following methods will then be
 * implemented:
 *
 * A default constructor.
 *
 * A constructor with all attributes as parameter.
 *
 * Getters methods and setters for each attribute.
 *
 * Upload method Cell(): the user is asked to enter the data
 * necessary to instantiate a Cellular object and to load it in our
 * program.
 *
 * Method Enter Code(): This method will allow you to enter the full
 * code of seven phone numbers. For this purpose, a repetitive loop
 * can be used
